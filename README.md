# Ideal gas simulation
Ideal gas simulation in a 3D system at temperature T and volume L^3, where L is the length of the walls.

Just execute it and theoretically it will work (as everything). 

The box is supposed to be a cube but you can change it to be the shape you want. By default, the volume remains constant during the animation but you can change it to be dynamic and study, for example, compressions and expansion.

I encourage you to study, as well as study volume changes, temperature (energy) changes.

As allways, all comments will be very grateful.
